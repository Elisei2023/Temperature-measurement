# Temperature-measurement
The purpose of the application is to measure an optimal temperature, depending on the geographical region, the volume of the room, and the people who live in that room as well as their type of activity. If the temperature is below the measurable set, a fine will be generated automatically after all the tenant's personal data has been entered.
